# jbd\_bms\_ros

### ROS node for Battery Management System by Jiabaida

## Overview

This ROS2 package reads Li-ion battery-related information returned by Jiabaida BMS and publishes it as topics.

The package publishes battery information such as SOC (State-Of-Charge) and error ID,
so that the main controller node can notice Low Voltage, High Temperature or any abnormality of Li-ion battery
and modify the control behaviour accordingly.

The package supports varying models of battery pack with differing number of cells or temperature sensors.


## Equipment Type

## Environment

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble

## Nodes

### `jbd_bms_status`

A ROS2 driver for battery management system from Jiabaida in China. It reads battery information and converts it to ROS2 topics.

#### Parameters

- `port` (type: `string`, default: `jbd_bms`)
    - Path to device file corresponding to USB-UART adapter connecting to Jiabaida BMS

- `baudrate` (type: `int`, default: `9600`)
    - Baudrate for UART communication to Jiabaida BMS

- `loop_rate` (type: `int`, default: `2`)
    - Topic output rate [Hz]

- `frame_id` (type: `string`, default: `jbd_bms`)
    - Used in header of `jbd_bms`

## Topics

- `jbd_bms`
- `diagnostics`


###  `jbd_bms`

State of battery sent from Jiabaida BMS.

Type: `jbd_bms_msg/JbdStatus`

#### `jbd_bms_msg/JbdStatus`

##### Error ID

| error_id | description                  |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 0        | Cell Overvoltage             |
| 1        | Cell Undervoltage            |
| 2        | Pack Overvoltage             |
| 3        | Pack Undervoltage            |
| 4        | Over-temp while charging     |
| 5        | Under-temp while charging    |
| 6        | Over-temp while discharging  |
| 7        | Under-temp while discharging |
| 8        | Overcurrent while charging   |
| 9        | Overcurrent while discharging|
| 10       | Short circuit                |
| 11       | Front-end IC error           |
| 12       | MosFET software lock-in      |
| 13       | Communication error          |

Note: Length of `error_id` becomes 0 when no error is detected


### `/diagnostics`

Diagnostics from Jiabaida BMS. Many human-readable messages on battery state.
